Over the last year, MOSAIC has quadrupled its spatiotemporal coverage, increased by ten-fold the number of variables it contains, and it is currently stored as a PostgreSQL spatial relational database. The complexity of this expanding database requires it to be dynamically queried through a user-friendly interface. Hence, this project aims to improve the accessibility to the database by creating an Application Programming Interface (API). This will be achieved by building an interactive and user-friendly web-interface that allows users to query MOSAIC. Finally, Python and R packages will also be built that allow researchers to incorporate MOSAIC in their data analysis and processing workflows, ensuring reproducibility of their findings.

Nowadays, instruments tend to discard most of the acquired data by down-sampling or discarding most of the signal via averaging or decimation. Saved data is normally stored into proprietary file formats, which limits the data exchange among the scientific community. It also impedes adding or modifying necessary metadata to keep important information about experiment parameters or instrument status, and hinders the use of existing post processing routines written for different file formats, leading to duplicated codes and preventing the exchange of routines among researchers.

Open-source data schemes are becoming increasingly important for scientific data storage. They enable sharing of software, data, and knowledge at early phases in the scientific process, maintain the digital integrity of the data at lower cost, and facilitate long-term preservation and future data mining through metadata. Developing software as open source allows modules to be readily shared, reused and extended by others. By choosing appropriate storage file open standards, it is possible to maximize available analysis tools and resources, reduce the cost of data manipulation and maintenance, and achieve ideal long-term preservation of large amounts of files.

In this project, we aim to implement the HDF5 and USID open standards on an already well-established ORD worldwide project at EPFL: the Open-Source SPM controller. Its current file scheme presents several weaknesses that we intend to overcome with these modern standards.

The original project successfully created a systematic machine-readable framework in which to categorise photo-electrochemical (PEC) systems, populated the database (72 papers, 154 reported devices) and developed an online interface for data entry and visualisation, focusing intentionally on photo-electrochemical water splitting (hydrogen production) to define a manageable research task. The initial ambition at project conception was always to expand to other solar fuels (e.g. CO₂ reduction towards CO, ethylene, ethanol, etc.) and methodologies (e.g. thermochemical H₂ production), so the existing database schema has been designed to be versatile and extensible. Specifically, we plan to extend the solar fuels considered to include carbon monoxide, syngas, formic acid, methane, ethanol, etc., and extend the technological pathways to include thermochemical redox cycles. Notably, there has been a recent focus on moving from solar hydrogen to solar-driven reduction of CO₂ to valuable chemicals and fuels. Consequently, the extended SolarFuelsDB database (SolarFuelsDB+) has the potential to unify multiple different solar fuel pathways into a single repository where reports can be found and performances of various technologies can be systematically and equitably compared. We will engage with international research communities to ensure a judicious selection of metadata is captured by the database. These reporting guidelines will facilitate standardization in data reporting, and inclusion in the database will provide an incentive for authors as inclusion of research could lead to improved findability and greater dissemination of results. In line with the open-science goals of this project, it is envisaged the database will become continually maintained through community submission of new papers. This greatly improved and openly accessible resource will consolidate previous work and provide the overview required to gain novel insight in to the field and thereby identify promising future research trends required to move solar fuels towards wide-scale implementation.",Open database,Solar fuels,Solar energy conversion,Standardization,database,1 Jul 2022,6,30000,WP1,Classification framework development,WP2,Website development,WP3,Population of extended database,WP4,Dissemination of results and meta-analysis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,open research data,FAIR,photoelectrochemical,thermochemical,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, hybrid models pose unique challenges to open research practices, including the widely accepted FAIR principles. Unlike physics-based models, the reusability of hybrid models is hindered by the integration of ML models which dynamically change with training data. Furthermore, existing model and data repositories are not designed to host hybrid models which contain code, ML models, and associated training data. To address these challenges, FRAME will collaboratively design, implement, and test a standardised FAIR protocol tailored for hydrological hybrid models. The protocol will consist of coding standards for interoperability between different model components, a unified metadata specification accounting for different types of physics and ML-based models, and a python package leveraging existing model and data repositories widely used in the hydrology (HydroShare) and ML (DLHub) communities to share and retrieve hybrid models.

This challenge comes to the fore when conducting transdisciplinary (Td) research, where new forms of engagement between science and society co-produce problem framings and project outputs. In this context, questions of who processes and stores data are increasingly important. Td research makes frequent use of qualitative methods, especially interviews and workshops. Sharing of this data could allow for improved learning between Td processes and increase engagement between science and society. How might this data be shared according to FAIR principles? What are appropriate protocols for determining what data to share and how to navigate the ethical issues of research participant protection and the benefits of sharing qualitative data? In this project we will prototype tools for FAIR qualitative data within Td research projects, develop standards and guidelines for other Td researchers and build a dialogue and community of practice within the Td research community around FAIR practices for qualitative data.",transdisciplinary research,qualitative methods,FAIR data practices,mixed media data,open science,1 Sep 2024,18,150000,WP1,Identification of ORD tools and workflows for publication of FAIR qualitative research data,WP2,Evaluation of current data practices for qualitative data in Td research and identification of training and education needs for FAIR data practices,WP3,Development of guidelines and protocols for FAIR qualitative data in Td research,WP4,Building a community of practice for FAIR qualitative data in Td research,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the current era of digitalization, driven by technological advancements, the field is undergoing a profound transformation, delivering unprecedented details crucial for enhanced comprehension and exploration across various research domains. However, the absence of a suitable repository and the emerging imbalance between resource-intensive data producers and users pose significant challenges to data-sharing practices. This project aims to address these challenges by showcasing an operational solution, exemplified through intra-annually resolved wood cell anatomical data and images, involving the establishment of a modern, robust, and flexible repository and simultaneous redefinition of incentives for data producers. The Xcell Hub, through the creation of a community-specific, interactive, visualizable, and user-friendly online data repository, aims to foster Open Research Data (ORD) practices. Specifically, the project will develop an ORD-oriented operational web-based prototype designed for handling and hosting intra-annual resolved tree-ring data, focusing initially on Quantitative Wood Anatomy (QWA) data produced with the ROXAS software. The hub will collect, harmonize, centralize, preserve, and archive QWA data, metadata, and images, promoting openness, reproducibility, and collaboration between data producers and users. Features include a user-friendly Shiny web interface linked to a PostgreSQL database, comprehensive documentation, interactive data visualization, and a data policy that encourages sharing while recognizing contributors.

This involves developing a tool, OpenPulse, to monitor OSS activities, establish reliable OSS datasets, and create visualizations for real-time impact assessment. The project emphasizes collaboration, community engagement, and the development of discipline-specific dashboards, aiming to foster a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of Open Science's impact beyond traditional publications.

This therefore falls within the objective of both specifying ORD standards and prototyping a new ORD tool for monitoring Open Science outputs and their impact. Through providing visibility to these outputs, our intention is also to help researchers build and find their communities to engage in collaboration around shared resources.
