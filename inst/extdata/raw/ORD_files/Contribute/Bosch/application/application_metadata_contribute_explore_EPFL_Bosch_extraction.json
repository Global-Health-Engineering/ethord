However, despite their ubiquity, methods to process and store geospatial time series datasets are often disperse and lack standard practices. A key reason for such a shortcoming is the inherent heterogeneity and irregularity of time series data.In this proposal, we aim to address these challenges by developing TSDF, a new data specification that provides a flexible framework to access, process, store and share geospatial time series datasets. A binary format based on Apache Parquet will be designed to provide flexible and effective hierarchical structuring of time series measurements, enabling scalable and distributed processing of irregular and heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, a Python package will be developed to provide an easy interface to load the datasets into pandas data frames, with methods to facilitate operations such as filtering, reducing and combining the data. The proposed work can greatly facilitate the processing of geospatial time series data in a vast body of applications, reducing data wrangling time for researchers while enhancing interoperability, reusability and collaboration.",
