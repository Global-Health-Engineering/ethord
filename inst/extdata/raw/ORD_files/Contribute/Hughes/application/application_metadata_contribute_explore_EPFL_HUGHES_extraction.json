    "project_abstract": "The rapid development of soft materials with incorporated sensing properties has diverse applications in wearable devices, healthcare, and soft robotics. Soft sensors can detect strain, force, temperature, humidity, and more, emulating human skin's sensing abilities. This interdisciplinary field combines robotics, materials science, and data science. However, developing soft sensors is challenging due to the linked mechanical and sensing properties, requiring simultaneous data reporting for optimization. To address this, we require open access data-sets that enable comparison and analysis of different sensors. Current data collection methods using expensive equipment and post-processing hinder progress. We propose a novel hardware solution based upon low-cost 3D printer platforms which could offer promising solutions to foster and enable this ORD practice. In this project we seek to formally contribute the openly available hardware design and software to enable curation of data is a data format that is aligned with ORD best practises. This will involve making the designs and software openly available and findable under FAIR principles and providing the necessary documentation in a manner that is easy to update. The software scripts must be developed to generate output data that is FAIR compliant and best supports ORD practices. A second aspect of this project is to disseminate the enabling technologies by participating in key workshops on the topic of ‘open hardware’.",
