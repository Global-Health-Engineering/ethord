Unrestricted access to sequence data and metadata is necessary for scientific innovation and re-use, and is consequently required by the scientific community, certain journals, and funding agencies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, many microbiome studies suffer from poor data accessibility and metadata interoperability, hampering scientific advancement.<br/><br/>The project aims to close open research data (ORD) gaps in the microbiome field by addressing (1) the ineffectiveness of sequence data availability statements, which leads to poor reporting, reproducibility, and re-use; and (2) lack of consistent metadata standards for annotating microbial ORD.<br/>We propose a two-pronged solution in (1) developing a tier-based FAIR ORD standard for the field, and (2) building software to assess adherence to FAIR ORD standards. This project would contribute open resources intended for use by a diverse range of users, including researchers, journals, and funding agencies.<br/><br/>Combined with the tier-based system, validation software will enable users to assess how well microbiome studies meet data availability and metadata standards. The tools and guidelines developed here will improve sequence data and metadata reporting practices for greater accessibility, interoperability, and future re-use.",
