To overcome this, the Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC) database was devised to understand the factors that affect the distribution of the quantity, origin and reactivity of organic carbon in marine sediments, a key component of the global carbon cycle of growing interest with respect to carbon stocktaking and ecosystem services. Over the last year, MOSAIC has quadrupled its spatiotemporal coverage, increased by ten-fold the number of variables it contains, and it is currently stored as a PostgreSQL spatial relational database. The complexity of this expanding database requires it to be dynamically queried through a user-friendly interface. Hence, this project aims to improve the accessibility to the database by creating an Application Programming Interface (API). This will be achieved by building an interactive and user-friendly web-interface that allows users to query MOSAIC. Finally, Python and R packages will also be built that allow researchers to incorporate MOSAIC in their data analysis and processing workflows, ensuring reproducibility of their findings. This project will provide accessibility of the database to users with different backgrounds and interests, building on Open Research Data practices in marine geosciences.",
