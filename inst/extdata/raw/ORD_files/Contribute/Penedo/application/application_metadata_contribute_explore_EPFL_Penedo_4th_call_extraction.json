    "project_abstract": "Storing acquired data is a crucial step in every research cycle. Nowadays, instruments tend to discard most of the acquired data by down-sampling or discarding most of the signal via averaging or decimation. Saved data is normally stored into proprietary file formats, which limits the data exchange among the scientific community. It also impedes adding or modifying necessary metadata to keep important information about experiment parameters or instrument status, and hinders the use of existing post processing routines written for different file formats, leading to duplicated codes and preventing the exchange of routines among researchers.\n\nOpen-source data schemes are becoming increasingly important for scientific data storage. They enable sharing of software, data, and knowledge at early phases in the scientific process, maintain the digital integrity of the data at lower cost, and facilitate long-term preservation and future data mining through metadata. Developing software as open source allows modules to be readily shared, reused and extended by others. By choosing appropriate storage file open standards, it is possible to maximize available analysis tools and resources, reduce the cost of data manipulation and maintenance, and achieve ideal long-term preservation of large amounts of files.\n\nIn this project, we aim to implement the HDF5 and USID open standards on an already well-established ORD worldwide project at EPFL: the Open-Source SPM controller. Its current file scheme presents several weaknesses that we intend to overcome with these modern standards. Furthermore, the implementation of this scheme will enable access to a lively open software ecosystem called Pycroscopy, allowing the Open-Source SPM project to take advantage of all the functionalities and tools already existing in that ecosystem based on the HDF5 and USID open standards.",
