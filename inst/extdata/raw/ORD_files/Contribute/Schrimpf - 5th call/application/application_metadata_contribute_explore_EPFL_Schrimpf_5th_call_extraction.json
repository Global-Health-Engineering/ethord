By translating models from machine learning into neuroscientific hypotheses, and neuroscience data into quantitative benchmarks to evaluate such models, Brain-Score makes computational as well as experimental advances available to the broader community in a synergistic manner. In this proposal, we aim to broaden the scope of Brain-Score to data from human experiments which will open the platform to the cognitive neuroscience community and make computational models more broadly applicable.<br/><br/>Specifically, we will:- Contribute new software to the Brain-Score platform to enable it to work with human data. This involves defining new endpoints for computational models to align with human brain anatomy and a common experimental behavioral task.\n- Curate the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD, Allen et al. 2022) for Brain-Score such that it is accessible for reproducible model evaluations. NSD is a large-scale dataset of human whole-brain recordings in response to thousands of natural images.\n- Curate the THINGS-similarity dataset (Hebart et al. 2020) for addition into Brain-Score to make it accessible and reproducible for model evaluations. THINGS-similarity is a human behavioral dataset of millions of similarity judgments for thousands of images.",
