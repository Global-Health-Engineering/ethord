The latter adopts a modular and interoperable microservice architecture providing highly optimised and scalable general-purpose computational imaging functionalities and tools, easy to reuse and share across imaging modalities. One key specificity of the framework is its domain-agnosticity, which helps it remain lightweight (with only a few core dependencies), accessible to most imaging scientists, and portable/scalable across computing platforms and imaging modalities. However, this domain-agnosticity also limits the adoption of the framework by certain imaging communities with very specific computational imaging needs. This project adresses this issue by introducing Pycsou FAIR, a web platform, meta-programming framework and interoperability protocol for Pycsou aiming at facilitating the discovery, installation, development and sharing of FAIR-compliant community-based image reconstruction plugins at scale. This platform will allow imaging scientists to develop, share and take full advantage of modern computational imaging methods in their routine processing pipelines.",
