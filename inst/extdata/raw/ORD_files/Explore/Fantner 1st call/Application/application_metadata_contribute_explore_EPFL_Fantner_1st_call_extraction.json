    "project_abstract": "Scientific instruments these days are often sophisticated, intelligent systems consisting of complex hardware, electronics, and software components. To innovate in the technique, one must get access to all levels; instrument, hardware, software. Unfortunately, most commercial instrument manufacturers keep their technology proprietary, and provide very little access to the hardware and software. Before one can improve things, one has to either hack into the commercial system, or completely re-engineer the instrument. In our research field (scanning probe microscopy) this has become painfully noticeable as a marked decrease in innovation. In this project we propose to bring together the community to share and standardise their hardware and software developments in the field of SPM. The goal is to reach an open development ecosystem in which new and existing research projects can be embedded without having to first reinvent the wheel. We plan to leverage our existing open hardware AFM projects and their early adopters to generate an OpenSPM ecosystem consisting of the Open Hardware tools (hardware and software), an extensive knowledge base and development resources, a world-wide user community, and a sourcing platform that helps people adopt the open hardware.",
