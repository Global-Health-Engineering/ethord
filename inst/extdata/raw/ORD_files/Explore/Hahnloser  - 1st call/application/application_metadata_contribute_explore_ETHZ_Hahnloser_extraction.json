Thanks to open research data (ORD) such as open access publications, the world’s scientific output is increasingly accessible. But access to this massive trove of data is not enough—we must be able to assimilate the knowledge it contains and put it to good use. We need accessory technologies to harness knowledge for the world’s benefit. Search engines and their keyword-driven interfaces are very limited in their ability to bring scientific knowledge to end users, i.e. researchers with specific questions and authors of scientific manuscripts. Tasks such as discovering, reviewing, summarizing, and generating discussions from the scientific literature are easier to accomplish as our Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques advance. We propose to radically increase the value of the vast trove of open access scientific content by aggregating an OR database of more than 140 Million papers and by providing interfaces to state-of-the-art NLP tools. We intend to publish the code and content of this database, to provide access via an application programming interface (API), and to operate a web-based application that uses NLP algorithms to help authors of scientific manuscripts to assimilate the scientific literature. Our efforts will help scientists discover, characterize, and harness the store of knowledge in open access publications and streamline the scientific discovery and writing processes.",
