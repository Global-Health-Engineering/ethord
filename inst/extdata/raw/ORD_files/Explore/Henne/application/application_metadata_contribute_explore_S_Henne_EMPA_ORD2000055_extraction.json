    "project_abstract": "Inverse modelling of greenhouse gas emissions is a powerful tool combining atmospheric observations and transport simulations to provide policy-relevant, real-world emission estimates. Inverse modelling requires computational workflows that deal with multiple atmospheric model simulations, pre- and post-processing steps, inversion codes and collection/aggregation of results across an ensemble of individual realisations. These steps are not handled in a traceable, repeatable and user-friendly way. Here, we propose to use the 'Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science' AiiDA system to develop prototype workflows and implement plugins for automation of the above steps. AiiDA is a well-established tool in the field of computational material science within the ETH-domain. We will build on its flexible structure to transfer its powers to the atmospheric modelling community, specifically that of inverse modelling. We will interact with our Swiss and European partners to design generic workflows that can be easily adopted by other researchers working on inverse modelling. Our implementation will improve the traceability, repeatability, findability, and sharing of emission estimates that are crucial in the assessment of climate change policy and legislation. We expect to carry the achievements beyond the use in our own group to other researchers with whom we cooperate closely in the context of international and European programmes and projects.",
