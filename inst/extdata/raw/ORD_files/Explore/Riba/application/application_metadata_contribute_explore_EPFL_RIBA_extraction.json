    "project_abstract": "OpenPulse: Assessing Open Science community metrics for Open Source Software aims to redefine the measurement of Open Science by focusing on Open Source Software (OSS) from EPFL. It addresses the limitations of current Open Science metrics, which primarily track Open Access publications, by proposing a new framework to evaluate the development of OSS and its community impact. This involves developing a tool, OpenPulse, to monitor OSS activities, establish reliable OSS datasets, and create visualizations for real-time impact assessment. The project emphasizes collaboration, community engagement, and the development of discipline-specific dashboards, aiming to foster a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of Open Science's impact beyond traditional publications. Our project aims to solve that issue, by investigating ways to identify Open Source Software coming out of EPFL, defining measures of their FAIRness and investigating community metrics that will provide us with an understanding of the impact and health of a project. This therefore falls within the objective of both specifying ORD standards and prototyping a new ORD tool for monitoring Open Science outputs and their impact. Through providing visibility to these outputs, our intention is also to help researchers build and find their communities to engage in collaboration around shared resources. Crucially, we hold the view that Open Science extends beyond institutional boundaries and is instead rooted in discipline-specific communities and their individual definitions of the concept. The project will therefore involve workshops to consult researchers about the needs of their specific communities, and build individual dashboards that are catered to these needs. Once the project is robust and deployed, expansion to inter institutional collaborations will be developed.",
