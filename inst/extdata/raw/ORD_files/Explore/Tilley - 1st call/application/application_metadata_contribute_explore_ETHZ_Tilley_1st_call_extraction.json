This project addresses this gap by building the openwashdata community, which will support members in using open-source computational tools and further developing competencies consistent with FAIR data standards. The community aims to facilitate the publication of over 50 previously unpublished datasets contributed by members, fostering open science. The project also seeks to develop a global community of students and practitioners, create an accessible open data platform for WASH-related data, and research the technical, pedagogical, and political factors necessary for expanding and replicating this initiative to become the most comprehensive host and training platform in the open science WASH sector. The ultimate goal is to build a lasting, passionate network of WASH professionals applying FAIR data principles to benefit the entire sector.",
