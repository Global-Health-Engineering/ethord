However, the availability and accessibility of use data in the public domain is limited. For many chemicals and materials, use data have been reported, but they cannot be readily extracted and used by scientists, regulators and the industry on a large scale. This is because they are scattered over the public domain, and are often reported using different terminologies and in a non-machine-readable/processable format. Against this background, this project aims to enable and engage the scientific and regulatory communities to build up open FAIR data on the uses of chemicals and materials by developing and disseminating a toolbox of the missing tools. In particular, the toolbox will include a standard and templates for future reporting, as well as a set of novel cheminformatics and natural language processing-based workflows and tools for automated extraction and harmonization of existing reporting from different types of sources, to be used by researchers within the ETH-Domain, as well as external researchers including industrial scientists, regulators, and civil society organisations. The project will take a participatory approach, with stakeholders within and outside the ETH-Domain to be engaged in the testing, finalization and dissemination of the toolbox.",
